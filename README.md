# CNN for Real-time Gesture Recognition and Task Control

This project is aiming on hand gesture recognition, four methods, color detection, convolutional neural network, optical flow, mathematical method are proposed and implemented to control video games which makes human computer interaction more interesting and creative. (This repo only contains CNN model)

Five gesture types, ”OK”, ”Peace”, ”Punch”, ”Stop” and ”Nothing”
